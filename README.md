# Dice Game

## Overview
Welcome to my first project: the Dice Game! I've built this exciting game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's how it works:

- There are two dice: Die 1 represents Player 1, and Die 2 represents Player 2.
- When you roll the dice, each will display a random value.
- The player whose die shows the higher value wins!

It's a simple yet fun way to determine a winner. Roll the dice and may the best player win!
